Hi! This is an utility created in order to farm Twitch drops events.

You have to download the Google Chrome Webdriver, set into the application and enter username, password and Game Category Name. You are completly free to inspect my code and check that I'm not making a malicious use of your personal data.

It's a project made in a few hours, just for fun (and motivated in let the computer watching streams all night long).

Good farm!~

Lastest release:
https://github.com/MDoloresGui/TwitchDropsFarmer/releases/download/v1.1.0/TwitchDropsFarmer-1_1_0.jar

Note: make sure you have your Twitch's email open in other browser. This bot can't handle (yet, and possibly never) with Twitch's Double Authentification.
Note 2: check the category URL when you enter the game name. e.g.: the game name for [https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Black%20Desert%20Online] is Black Desert Online. I'm working on make a more user-friendly system.
